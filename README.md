## FAQ

#### How do I use it?

Simply download the file named as "install-script" and execute it. The file will download the necessary dependencies and setup the project for you. After the installation is complete, type out "wacomui" in you terminal to open the program.

#### Does it work for my distro?

Maybe, it's allways possible that a dependency the script tried to install no longer exists under that name or that I simply forgot to check for your specific OS. Check if you are able to install the dependencies on your own (Java 21, Lua 5.X and xsetwacom). If the awnser is yes, than go to the master branch and download "xsetWacomRE-last.jar". You can open your terminal and execute it with "java -jar xsetWacomRE-last.jar".

#### Something is broken/could be improved. How do I fix it?

Send me a request and I will try my best to fix it.

#### Why is there no way simple way to configure tablet/stylus buttons?

Skill issue. Couldn't find a way to make it easy to interact with.
